My name is Ahmad Hossein Yazdani. I got my bachelor's in computer software engineering from the University of Tehran Iran in 2020. Currently, I'm doing my PhD at Virginia Tech. University in Blacksburg, VA, US since August 2020 in computer science under the supervision of Dr. Ali Butt at Distributed System and Storage Lab. I have also experienced doing intern at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, supervised by Feiyi Wang, Sarp Oral, Ahmad Maroof Karimi, and Arnab Kamur Paul. Additionally, I have served as an intern at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, the United States under the supervision of Suren Byna and Jean Luca Bez. 
which is to extend my research on identifying the sources of I/O variance in HPC systems. I recently did another internship at NERSC, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) which was on finding directions to resolve the false warnings of Drishti, and I/O recommender tool for HPC applications, and to concretize its recommendations (Like 
predicting the I/O performance when an unseen configuration is proposed) under the supervision of Stephen Simms, Lisa Gerhardt, and Jean Luca Bez.

I'm interested in distributed systems optimization, resource management, cloud computing, and high-performance computing (HPC). My current research is on optimizing distributed systems for running various aspects of Machine Learning including training deep neural networks, federated learning, and boosting GPU scheduling algorithms to fit ML workloads. Moreover, I research how to improve the I/O performance of HPC workloads, or to reduce I/O contention in other words. I'm also enthusiastic about learning and researching cloud computing.
